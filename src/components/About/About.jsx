                          ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! I'm Rani Saini, a passionate Node.js developer with one year of hands-on experience in crafting robust and scalable web applications. My journey in the world of web development began with a keen interest in creating efficient and dynamic solutions.
                          Over the past year, I've honed my skills in Node.js, leveraging its asynchronous, event-driven architecture to build high-performance backends. My expertise extends to creating RESTful APIs, implementing real-time features with WebSocket, and optimizing application performance.
                          </p>

                      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-900">
                      ðŸ’¡ I'm adept at working with popular Node.js frameworks like Express.js, and I have a solid understanding of server-side rendering and middleware integration. My commitment to clean, maintainable code is reflected in my approach to application architecture and the use of best practices.
                      </p>

                      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-900">
                      ðŸ“š As I continue to grow in my role as a Node.js developer, I look forward to contributing my skills and enthusiasm to projects that push the boundaries of what web applications can achieve. Let's build something amazing together! ðŸ’»âœ¨
